                <h2>Risk Management Process</h2>
                <p>Handling risks is an important part of measuring success within software engineering. This importance is emphasised for group projects, as many uncertainties can occur in a limited timeframe. <br>
                <h3>Identification</h3>
                Risks were identified through team brainstorming sessions, review of the ENG1 product brief, and by considering the risk categories suggested in the ENG1 Lecture slides:
                <br><br>
                To identify risks, the team reviewed the product brief and had brainstorming sessions, considering the different categories of risks. Such categories are listed below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Project risks - Scheduling, resources, team management. </li>
                    <li>Product risks - Quality, correctness, completeness of the game.</li>    
                    <li>Technical risks - Tools, libraries, IDEs, technologies used.</li> 
                    <li>Requirements risks - Unclear or evolving requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>Each risk is assessed using a qualitative scale for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Likelihood: Low (L), Medium (M), High (H).</li>
                    <li>Severity: Low (L), Medium (M), High (H). </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This ensures simple but effective prioritisation, appropriate for our student project.</p>
                <h3>Planning & Mitigation</h3>
                <p>For each risk we define:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mitigation strategies –  actions to reduce likelihood or impact.</li>
                    <li>Contingency plans –  fallback approaches if mitigation fails.</li>
                    <li>Ownership – a team member responsible for monitoring the risk.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Monitoring</h3> 
                <p>Every week during the team meetings, we will review the risks. The owners will reconsider how likely and severe they are, adding any new ones if found. To keep track of accountability, updates on risk status will be noted.
                </p>

                <h2>Review plan</h2>
                <p>Based on the risks we’ve identified, the team has decided on multiple points of action to reduce the likelihood of these risks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risks will be reviewed weekly in team meetings.</li>
                    <li>Owners will update likelihood/severity as the project progresses.</li>
                    <li>Any crucial risks will be communicated at once to the group and mentioned in any related project documents.</li>
                    <li>Before submission, we will do a last check to make sure that the mitigation methods have been implemented properly.</li>
