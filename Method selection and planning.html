                <h2>Software Engineering Methods and Tools</h2>
                <p>A method in software engineering lays out the way a team transforms requirements into an operational system. It gives a basis for design, implementation and testing while handling alteration and risk. 
                <br>
                There are two main types of methods: plan driven and agile. Plan driven approaches depend on comprehensive planning and documentation. On the other hand, agile techniques emphasise flexibility, brief feedback cycles and functional software. Considering the short time frame allocated for our project and small team size, we will adopt a lightweight agile method inspired by Scrum. This approach encourages continuous adjustment and iterative delivery.
                </p>

                <p>Plan-driven methods work best for large, stable projects. Agile methods, on the other hand, cope well with uncertainty, short time frames, and rapidly changing ideas, which aligns closely with our project.</p>
                <h3>Chosen Method: Agile (Scrum-Inspired)</h3>
                <p>Our team will follow an agile technique based on Scrum. Development will proceed in short, one-week sprints. Each sprint begins with a planning meeting, followed by implementation and testing, and ends with a review where progress and problems are discussed. This method offers regular feedback, visible progress and flexibility. This means we get to make plans for small, achievable goals that can be accomplished fast, react to what’s not working and ensure that the quality of the code doesn’t fall too far before it’s an issue. Each sprint aims to deliver a working and testable build of the game. </p>

                <h3>Resource allocation and Roles</h3>
                <p>At least one team member will support each work package. The shared ownership of code means that everyone can contribute to any part if they wish, but designated coders give guidance and are responsible for the code overall. All members will help with testing and reviewing documents to keep things consistent and high quality, but also so that everyone is satisfied.</p>
                <h3>Monitoring and Planning Changes</h3>
                <p>The plan will be discussed each week and at the end of every sprint, if something is running late, resources will be reallocated or the scope will be adjusted to maintain progress. Progress will be monitored by the team using the Gantt chart, GitHub, and Google Docs activity. Plans will be updated continuously to reflect actual progress, ensuring the project adapts effectively to any issues that may arise.</p>
