                <h2>Single Statement of Need</h2>
                <p>Our Client has requested a single-player game which allows the player to escape a maze, wrapped in the guise of a University. There are three primary objectives for this project which have been outlined by our customer: The user should be able to escape within five minutes; There should be multiple events to interact with, some of which are hidden; There should be an opposing force working against the user. 
                <br><br>
                However, as developers, we recognise that there are many additional requirements for this project. As such, we arranged a meeting with our client to discuss and gather these additional requirements. A prior brainstorming session led us to compiling a list of questions to ask our client, allowing us to delve into the functionalities and wishes of the customer. This meeting was valuable to discovering the needs of our client, giving a clearer understanding of customer-needs and specifications. In the long-term, continuing to discuss and collaborate with our Client will aid in avoiding customer frustration and misunderstandings; also aligning with an agile approach to software development, prioritising customer collaboration. 
                <br><br>
                While this customer research gave us an insight into User Requirements, we understand that there is a hierarchy of requirement types and complexity. To level this complexity, we have separated our requirements into User Requirements and System Requirements. The latter is further divided into Functional, Non-Functional, and Constraint Requirements. This gives a simple classification of key requirements, which in themselves are given an appropriate Requirement ID. This allows us to easily reference and link requirements when needed. We intend for our system to meet all requirements that ‘shall’ be done in our specification. This ensures our final project meets as many of our clients primary objectives as possible. 
                <br><br>
                In summary: using the requirements elicited from the client, we will create a Maze Game based in a University, where the user should be able to escape within five minutes. After consulting our clients, as developers we have chosen to include multiple variants of boons and obstacles to interact with, as well as incorporating an environmental narrative to capture the interest of users. </p>

                <p>User Requirements outline the general features and tasks the users should be able to carry out within the game.</p>

                <h2>System Requirements</h2>
                <p>System requirements describe how the game will meet the needs of prospective players from a technical point of view. They will describe how we deliver key functionalities, such as player movement across the map, event completion, and interaction with items that affect the player’s progress. 
                <br><br>
                Each System Requirement supports a user requirement — for example, balancing gameplay difficulty and designing the map both contribute to allowing players to complete the game on time. This allows us to keep track of User Expectations, and supports game development, ensuring that it runs smoothly.
